# archway-proto

# main script
- src/codeGenRunner.js is core file that does the codegen work
- the path to proto files is set in protoDirs
- note as the proto files change the codeGenRunner configs may need to change for a correct gen to happen
- note any imports of a proto file MUST be included into the workspace proto folder
    - for example proto/archway/rewards/v1beta1/events.proto does an import of gogoproto/gogo.proto, so this file was added into proto/gogoproto/gogo.proto
    - use the scripts/import-proto-and-deps.sh script to get both all protos and their dependencies

# scripts
- arch:dev:gen and arch:prod:gen generate the ts codegen files in root of src folder
    - make certain all proto files and their imports exist already in proto folder
- arch:ts can then be run after to generate the d.ts typescript files inside of the types folder
- arch:main and arch:module will generate the codegen files as raw js

## Usage
### RPC Clients

```js
import { archway } from 'archway-proto';

const { createRPCQueryClient } = archway.ClientFactory; 
const client = await createRPCQueryClient({ rpcEndpoint: RPC_ENDPOINT });

// now you can query the cosmos modules
const balance = await client.cosmos.bank.v1beta1
    .allBalances({ address: 'archway1addresshere' });

// you can also query the archway modules
const balances = await client.archway.exchange.v1beta1
    .exchangeBalances()
```

### Composing Messages

Import the `archway` object from `archway-proto`. 

```js
import { archway } from 'archway-proto';

const {
    createSpotLimitOrder,
    createSpotMarketOrder,
    deposit
} = archway.exchange.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

#### CosmWasm Messages

```js
import { cosmwasm } from "archway-proto";

const {
    clearAdmin,
    executeContract,
    instantiateContract,
    migrateContract,
    storeCode,
    updateAdmin
} = cosmwasm.wasm.v1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;
```

#### IBC Messages

```js
import { ibc } from 'archway-proto';

const {
    transfer
} = ibc.applications.transfer.v1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl
```

#### Cosmos Messages

```js
import { cosmos } from 'archway-proto';

const {
    fundCommunityPool,
    setWithdrawAddress,
    withdrawDelegatorReward,
    withdrawValidatorCommission
} = cosmos.distribution.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;

const {
    multiSend,
    send
} = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;

const {
    beginRedelegate,
    createValidator,
    delegate,
    editValidator,
    undelegate
} = cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;

const {
    deposit,
    submitProposal,
    vote,
    voteWeighted
} = cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MessageComposer.fromPartial;
```

## Connecting with Wallets and Signing Messages

⚡️ For web interfaces, we recommend using [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit). Continue below to see how to manually construct signers and clients.

Here are the docs on [creating signers](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/tree/main/packages/react#signing-clients) in cosmos-kit that can be used with Keplr and other wallets.

### Initializing the Stargate Client

Use `getSigningarchwayClient` to get your `SigningStargateClient`, with the proto/amino messages full-loaded. No need to manually add amino types, just require and initialize the client:

```js
import { getSigningarchwayClient } from 'archway-proto';

const stargateClient = await getSigningarchwayClient({
  rpcEndpoint,
  signer // OfflineSigner
});
```
### Creating Signers

To broadcast messages, you can create signers with a variety of options:

* [cosmos-kit](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/cosmos-kit/tree/main/packages/react#signing-clients) (recommended)
* [keplr](https://docs.keplr.app/api/cosmjs.html)
* [cosmjs](https://gist.github.com/webmaster128/8444d42a7eceeda2544c8a59fbd7e1d9)
### Amino Signer

Likely you'll want to use the Amino, so unless you need proto, you should use this one:

```js
import { getOfflineSignerAmino as getOfflineSigner } from 'cosmjs-utils';
```
### Proto Signer

```js
import { getOfflineSignerProto as getOfflineSigner } from 'cosmjs-utils';
```

WARNING: NOT RECOMMENDED TO USE PLAIN-TEXT MNEMONICS. Please take care of your security and use best practices such as AES encryption and/or methods from 12factor applications.

```js
import { chains } from 'chain-registry';

const mnemonic =
  'unfold client turtle either pilot stock floor glow toward bullet car science';
  const chain = chains.find(({ chain_name }) => chain_name === 'archway');
  const signer = await getOfflineSigner({
    mnemonic,
    chain
  });
```
### Broadcasting Messages

Now that you have your `stargateClient`, you can broadcast messages:

```js
const { send } = cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MessageComposer.withTypeUrl;

const msg = send({
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'coin',
        amount: '1000'
    }
    ],
    toAddress: address,
    fromAddress: address
});

const fee: StdFee = {
    amount: [
    {
        denom: 'coin',
        amount: '864'
    }
    ],
    gas: '86364'
};
const response = await stargateClient.signAndBroadcast(address, [msg], fee);
```

## Advanced Usage


If you want to manually construct a stargate client

```js
import { OfflineSigner, GeneratedType, Registry } from "@cosmjs/proto-signing";
import { AminoTypes, SigningStargateClient } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

import { 
    cosmosAminoConverters,
    cosmosProtoRegistry,
    cosmwasmAminoConverters,
    cosmwasmProtoRegistry,
    ibcProtoRegistry,
    ibcAminoConverters,
    archwayAminoConverters,
    archwayProtoRegistry
} from 'archway-proto';

const signer: OfflineSigner = /* create your signer (see above)  */
const rpcEndpint = 'https://rpc.cosmos.directory/archway'; // or another URL

const protoRegistry: ReadonlyArray<[string, GeneratedType]> = [
    ...cosmosProtoRegistry,
    ...cosmwasmProtoRegistry,
    ...ibcProtoRegistry,
    ...archwayProtoRegistry
];

const aminoConverters = {
    ...cosmosAminoConverters,
    ...cosmwasmAminoConverters,
    ...ibcAminoConverters,
    ...archwayAminoConverters
};

const registry = new Registry(protoRegistry);
const aminoTypes = new AminoTypes(aminoConverters);

const stargateClient = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(rpcEndpoint, signer, {
    registry,
    aminoTypes
});
```

## Developing

When first cloning the repo:

```
yarn
yarn build
```

### Codegen

Contract schemas live in `./contracts`, and protos in `./proto`. Look inside of `scripts/codegen.js` and configure the settings for bundling your SDK and contracts into `archway-proto`:

```
yarn codegen
```

### Publishing

Build the types and then publish:

```
yarn build:ts
yarn publish
```
